# RNC - Rocket Nozzle Calculator

- Created as a tool for people who are learning about rocket nozzles calculations and are not familiar with coding to easily understand. Written initially for the Kingston University Rocket Engineering group (KURE).


- It takes operational conditions of the nozzles to calculate the dimensions as necessary and outputs the characteristics in a text file and a file with coordinates for the contour with the ability to adjust the output file for ANSYS, solidworks or CSV format. 

- There are plans for the addition of performance curves (pressure, mach number and temperature), the integration of aerospike nozzle calculations, regenerative cooling calculations and 3D model output. A python variant may be created at some point as well. *There is no formal timeline on these additions*

- Note calculations performed within this code are not necessarily correct and you should ensure they are before use. If any incorrect areas arise please contact me  and I will make the changes.
