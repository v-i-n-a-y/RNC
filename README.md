# RNC - Rocket Nozzle Calculator

Initially created as a tool for students who are learning about rocket nozzles calculations and are not familiar with coding to easily understand.

Written initially for the Kingston University Rocket Engineering group (KURE) and students specialising in aerospace engineering. 

Please note this calculations performed within this code is not necessarily right and you should ensure they are correct before using them. If any incorrect areas arise please contact me know and I will make the changes.
