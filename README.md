# RNC - Rocket Nozzle Calculator

- Initially written for the Kingston University Rocket Engineering group (KURE).

- Calculates nozzle characteristics and outputs them in a text file.

- Also calculates nozzle contour and outputs a file with the coordinates. Capable of outputting this file in the relevant format for ANSYS, solidworks or CSV. 

- There are plans for the addition of performance curves (pressure, mach number and temperature), the integration of aerospike nozzle calculations, regenerative cooling calculations and 3D model output.

- Note calculations performed within this code are not necessarily correct and you should ensure they are before use. If any incorrect areas arise please contact me  and I will make the changes.
